- Typescript
- Mongoose
- Mongodb
- Redis
- JsonWebToken
- Jest
- Docker
- Multer

## Highlights
- API key support
- Token based Authentication
- Role based Authorization
- Database dump auto setup
- vscode template support
- Unit Tests
- Integration Tests
- 75% plus Test Coverage
- Clean and modular codebase

## Notes
A few things are added to aid the learning process

- database dump is added to seed the database

# About Project
WhereIsMyMotivation is a concept where you see videos and quotes that can inspire you everyday. You will get information on great personalities and make them your perceived mentors. You can also subscribe to topics of your interests. 

You can track your happiness level and write down daily journals. You can also share things of interest from web to store in your motivation box.

Using this app can bring a little bit of happiness and energy to live an inspired life.

The Android App using this backend is also open-sourced. You can find the project here: [Modern Android Development - WhereIsMyMotivation](https://github.com/unusualcodeorg/wimm-android-app)

## API Framework Design

## Request-Response Flow
`
src → main.ts → app-module.ts → core.module.ts → apikey.guard.ts → auth.module.ts → auth.guard.ts → role.guard.ts → [feature].module.ts → [feature].controller.ts → [feature].service.ts → response.validation.ts → exception.handler.ts → response.transformer.ts

# Installation Instruction
vscode is the recommended editor - dark theme 

### Get the repo 
```bash
# clone repository recursively
git clone https://github.com/unusualcodeorg/wimm-node-app.git --recursive
```

### Install libraries
```bash
$ npm install
```

### Run Docker Compose
- Install Docker and Docker Compose. [Find Instructions Here](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

```bash
# install and start docker containers
docker-compose up -d
```
-  You will be able to access the api from http://localhost:3000

### Run Tests
```bash
docker exec -t tester npm run test:cov
```
If having any issue
- Make sure 3000 port is not occupied else change PORT in **.env** file.
- Make sure 27017 port is not occupied else change DB_PORT in **.env** file.
- Make sure 6379 port is not occupied else change REDIS_PORT in **.env** file.

## Run on the local machine
Change the following hosts in the **.env** and **.env.test**
- DB_HOST=localhost
- REDIS_HOST=localhost

Best way to run this project is to use the vscode `Run and Debug` button. Scripts are available for debugging and template generation on vscode.

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

### Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
